Pashkuli Music Notation (or Plain Music Notation) PNS

PNS is a new way of writing and reading Music (on screen, paper, blank surface).
It concerns the so called "Western" (it is actually Mediterranean) 12 note system, known as 12 Tone Equal Temperament (12-TET).

It has 12 distinctive and unique symbols and letter and names (syllables) for each of its 12 tones.
The 12 tones are arranged in rows (there is no need to draw staff lines!) and those rows represent the renovas - each cluster of the 12 notes in a frequency range. The old (and also inadequate) term for this is known as an "octave".
In this way, every note of the 12 named can be considered as a "clef" note, meaning also it is a renova separator, depending on the general or temporary structure of the written music in terms of Mode or Tonality.
Thus, music intervals (both harmonic and melodic) follow a simple rule of counting steps, derived from the consecuitive (chromatic) structure of the 12 music notes. There is no reference to any special case of a "reference mode" (as otherwise is the case with the old, "standard", music notation)

0 interval = unison (or single tone)
1 step (step) = prima, first (next tone)
2 steps (jump) = seconda, second (skip a tone)
3 steps (leap) = third (skip two tones)
4 steps = fourth
5 steps = fifth
6 steps (known as "tritonus") = sixth
and so on...
